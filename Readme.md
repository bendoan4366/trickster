# Trickster
Reinforcement learning homebrew-library

Currently Keras is supported and tested

## Algorithms
- REINFORCE
- DQN
- A2C

## On environments

Environments used must present an OpenAI Gym-like interface.

Windozers, check out Grund, my other homebrew-library for simple RL environmnets compatible with this lib.
Grund only depends on NumPy and OpenCV
